Ease of entry and exit, even for larger or mobility-challenged passengers, is well rated; and rear-seats are said to be usable by adults on longer trips. In all aspects of interior space and storage, the Pilot seems to have hit the mark. Other owner-stated plusses include confident traction from the fully automatic &ndash; though part-time &ndash; all-wheel drive system, and an excellent driving position, backed by above-average outward visibility.
